== Signature Tests

The signature tests validate the integrity of the `jakarta.data` Java "namespace" (or "package prefix") of the {APIShortName} implementation.
This would be especially important for an implementation packaging its own API JAR in which the API must be validated in its entirety.

For implementations expecting their users to rely on the API released by the {APILongName} specification project (e.g. to Maven Central) 
the signature tests are also important to validate that improper (non-spec-defined) 
extensions have not been added to `jakarta.data.\*` packages/classes/etc.

For more information about generating the signature test file, and how the signature test runs read: 
{signatureREADME}[ee.jakarta.tck.concurrent.framework.signaturetest/README.md]

=== Running signature tests

The {APILongName} TCK will run signature tests within a standalone or deployed application, 
and not as part of a separate plugin / execution.
This means that the signature tests will run during the maven `test` phase.

Your test client is configured with the property `jimage.dir=${project.build.directory}/jimage/`.
This is because, when running the signature tests on JDK 9+ we need to convert the 
JDK modules back into class files for signature testing.

The signature test plugin we use will also attempt to perform reflective access of classes, methods, and fields.
Due to the new module system in JDK 9+ special permissions need to be added in order for these tests to run: 

==== with Modules

By default the java.base module only exposes certain classes for reflective access. 
Therefore, the {APIShortName} TCK test will need access to the `jdk.internal.vm.annotation` class.
To give the `sigtest-maven-plugin` access to this class set the following JVM properties: 

[source, properties]
----
--add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.vm.annotation=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/jdk.internal.vm.annotation=ALL-UNNAMED
----

Some JDKs will mistake the space in the prior JVM properties as delimiters between properties
In this case use:

[source, properties]
----
--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.vm.annotation=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.vm.annotation=ALL-UNNAMED
---- 

=== Expected output

Here is example output when successfully running the signature tests:
