== Preface

This guide describes how to download, install, configure, and run the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) used to verify the compatibility of an implementation of the {APILongName} specification.  

The specification describes the job specification language, Java programming model, and runtime environment for {APILongName} applications.

=== Licensing

The {APILongName} TCK is provided under the {licenseURL}[*{license}*].

=== Who Should Use This Guide

This guide will assist in running the test suite, which verifies implementation compatibility for:

* Implementer of {APILongName}.

=== Terminology - "SE mode" vs. "EE mode"

The term "EE mode" when talking about the {APILongName} TCK distinguishes the requirements specifically for implementers running the TCK to certify against a Jakarta EE platform.
In contrast, the term "SE mode" distinguishes the requirements specifically for implementers running the TCK against a standalone implementation of the {APILongName} specification.

The {APILongName} specification has a subset of tests that can run in "SE mode" without the requirement of running against a Jakarta EE Platform.

=== Terminology - "Standalone TCK"

The community will sometimes refer to this TCK as the "standalone" {APIShortName} TCK.  This usage comes from the fact that {APILongName} is part of the Jakarta EE Platform, which has a platform-level TCK from which we are distinguishing this "standalone" TCK.  

This terminology is confusing, since the term "standalone" is overloaded to also mean that this TCK can be run in SE Mode which it can.
A better term would be `Specification TCK`, but that terminology is not yet being used.

=== Terminology - "Test Client" vs "Test Server"

When running in EE mode the {APILongName} TCK acts as a `Test Client` that will install test applications onto a Jakarta EE Platform Server.
The Platform Server will act as a `Test Server` and run tests based on incoming requests from the `Test Client`.
Assertions will occur both on the client and server sides.

=== Terminology - "Core Profile" vs "Web Profile" vs "Platform"

The Jakarta EE working group defines sets of specifications that create the core profile, web profile, and platform.
// TODO update this if Jakarta Data ends up being in something other than core profile
The {APILongName} TCK can run against each of these profiles since {APILongName} is a Core Profile specification.
