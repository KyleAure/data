/**
 * <p>Annotates a repository method that is search entities.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code Find} annotation indicates that the annotated repository method requests will execute a query by match parameter.
 * Thus, the types and names of the method parameters exactly match the types and names of the corresponding fields of the entity. Also,
 * there's no special naming convention for the @Find methodsâ€”they may be named arbitrarily, and their names encode no semantics.
 * </p>
 * <p>For example, consider an interface representing a garage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Repository}
 * interface Garage {
 *     {@code @Find}
 *     List<Car> getCarWithModel({@code @By("model"} String model);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>The {@code @Find} annotation can be used to indicate that the {@code getCarWithModel(model)} method is responsible for searching
 * a list of {@code Car} based at the model in parameter into a database.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>If this annotation is combined with other operation annotations (e.g., {@code @Update}, {@code @Delete},
 *  {@code @Save}), it will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} because only one operation type can be specified.
 *  A Jakarta Data provider implementation must detect (and report) this error at compile time or at runtime.</p>
